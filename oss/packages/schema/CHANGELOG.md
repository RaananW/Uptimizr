## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- e39cbc7: feat: optional `position` on `runtime_error` / `graphics_diagnostic` + spatial error heatmap (#154)

  Add an optional, best-effort `position` (`[x, y, z]`, the camera pose at the moment the event
  fired) to the `runtime_error` and `graphics_diagnostic` events. The Babylon connector stamps it
  automatically from the tracked camera; `sdk-core` gains a `setPositionProvider` seam so any connector
  can supply one, and enrichment happens centrally in `emitInternal` (before `beforeSend`, so it stays
  redactable). The field is additive and backward-compatible — older events simply omit it, and it
  reuses the already-promoted `position` column (no migration).

  On the read side, `@uptimizr/db` adds `buildErrorHeatmap` (voxel-bins positioned errors +
  diagnostics, with optional `severity`/`category`/`errorKind` filters), surfaced via the collector's
  new `GET /api/v1/heatmaps/errors` endpoint and a new **Error heatmap (3D)** dashboard panel
  (`@uptimizr/react`) reusing the world-heatmap view — revealing _where_ in the scene things break,
  not just _when_.

- 3c0a20b: feat(perf): add optional `position` to `frame_perf` + spatial FPS heatmap (#145)

  `frame_perf` samples can now carry the camera world-`position` at the moment
  they're taken, so the collector can show _where_ FPS drops, not just _when_. The
  Babylon connector fills it automatically from the tracked camera; other
  connectors may set it on the emitted event.

  - **schema**: `frame_perf.position` is an optional `vec3` (additive,
    backward-compatible — events still validate without it).
  - **sdk-core / babylon**: the perf snapshot threads an optional `position`
    through the aggregator into the emitted event; Babylon reads the tracked camera.
  - **db**: new dialect-agnostic `buildPerfHeatmap` voxel builder
    (`samples`/`avg_fps`/`min_fps`, ordered `avg_fps ASC`). Reuses the promoted
    `position` column — **no migration**.
  - **react**: new `perfHeatmap()` client method + **Performance heatmap (3D)**
    panel (reuses the world-heatmap renderer; hot = slow, honest per-voxel FPS on
    hover).

  The collector exposes it at `GET /api/v1/heatmaps/perf`.

- 3193a21: feat: add optional `uv` field for a per-mesh texture-space heatmap (#149)

  `pointer_click`, `mesh_interaction`, and `hover_dwell` now carry an optional,
  unclamped `uv: [u, v]` texture coordinate, captured by the Babylon connector from
  the raycast hit (`PickingInfo.getTextureCoordinates()`). It rides in the event
  `payload` — additive and backward-compatible, no column promotion or migration.

  A new `buildMeshUvHeatmap` query builder and `GET /api/v1/heatmaps/mesh-uv`
  endpoint bin a single mesh's `uv` values into a grid, surfaced by the dashboard's
  new **Mesh UV heatmap** panel (interactive mesh picker, defaults to the
  most-interacted mesh).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 08c4abd: Add the `graphics_diagnostic` event contract and the `captureGraphicsDiagnostics`
  opt-in flag (ADR 0021 part 2, foundation). The new event is a single
  engine-agnostic GPU-health signal with `severity`, `category`, optional `backend`
  (reusing the `graphics.api` enum), length-capped `message`/`code`, and a `count`
  field that discriminates a discrete incident marker from an aggregated per-session
  rollup. Capture is gated by the new `captureGraphicsDiagnostics` flag in
  `@uptimizr/sdk-core`, **off by default** (mirroring `captureErrors`);
  `context_lost`/`context_restored` stay always-on and exempt. No connector capture
  wiring yet — that lands in the per-signal slices.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fa6c472: Add a browser/OS performance segment derived from the request User-Agent at
  ingestion (#11). The collector reduces the User-Agent to a coarse, non-PII
  `{ browser, os }` pair (raw UA never stored) and merges it into
  `session_start.device`; `buildPerfByDevice` and the dashboard "FPS by device"
  panel now segment per-session median FPS by browser/OS in addition to graphics
  backend, mobile flag, and GPU renderer. No SDK, schema-capture, or storage
  migration change (ADR 0041).
- 32248e0: feat: reconstruct near-plane origin for flat-pointer click rays (ADR 0043)

  Flat pointers (mouse/touch/stylus) have no native pointing ray, so the click-ray heatmap
  (`/api/v1/heatmaps/click-rays`) collapsed every flat click to the nearest `camera_sample`
  position. Capture the camera's projection intrinsics and unproject each click's `screen` onto the
  camera near plane so flat-pointer rays fan out the way the clicks were actually made.

  - **`@uptimizr/schema`** — `camera_sample` gains optional `aspect` and `near` (alongside the
    existing `fov`).
  - **`@uptimizr/babylon`** — captures `engine.getAspectRatio(camera)` and `camera.minZ`, emitted
    only when finite and positive.
  - **`@uptimizr/db` / `@uptimizr/db-clickhouse`** — `fov`/`aspect`/`near` promoted to dedicated
    columns (forward-only migrations); `buildClickGazeRay` unprojects flat clicks onto the near
    plane using a canonical world-up / no-roll basis.

  Pose sources (XR/hand/gaze) keep their native ray origin (ADR 0011); missing intrinsics (legacy
  data) or a degenerate look-straight-up/down view fall back to the camera position, so existing
  behaviour and parity goldens are unchanged. Additive and non-breaking.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e22ebd: feat: caller-configured conversion-funnel aggregation (#78).

  Implements sub-issue (b) of the funnel epic in OSS. Authoring, persistence, and the
  saved-funnel dashboard panel remain hosted-only — the OSS dashboard stays a passive
  viewer (ADR 0038).

  - `@uptimizr/schema`: shared funnel contract — `funnelStepSchema`, `funnelStepsSchema`
    (2–20 steps), `funnelConfigSchema`, and `FUNNEL_CONFIG_VERSION`.
  - `@uptimizr/db`: new dialect-agnostic builder `buildFunnel` — a dynamic-N CTE chain
    using only `JOIN`/`min`/`GROUP BY` (no window or `ASOF` functions) so DuckDB and
    ClickHouse render identically (golden parity coverage on DuckDB). Semantics are
    sequential, first-touch, and monotonic.
  - `@uptimizr/collector-server`: new read endpoint `GET /api/v1/funnel`, wired through
    every store. The funnel definition is supplied per request as a `steps` JSON array
    (validated against `funnelStepsSchema`) and never stored.
  - `@uptimizr/react`: new client method `funnel(steps, params?)`.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- df5b66b: chore: point each package's npm `homepage` at its specific docs page (instead of the GitHub tree URL) and add an `author` field across the public manifests.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b2b7b44: Initial public release of Uptimizr — open-source, privacy-first analytics for 3D scenes.

  This first `0.1.0` ships the full open-source data collector: the `@uptimizr/schema` event
  contracts, the `@uptimizr/sdk-core` runtime, engine connectors (`@uptimizr/babylon`,
  `@uptimizr/babylon-lite`, `@uptimizr/three`, `@uptimizr/r3f`, `@uptimizr/aframe`,
  `@uptimizr/playcanvas`, `@uptimizr/react`), session `@uptimizr/replay`, the `@uptimizr/heatmap`
  renderer, the embedded-store `@uptimizr/db` layer, the `@uptimizr/mcp` server, and the
  `@uptimizr/collector-server` ingestion/query API plus the `@uptimizr/dashboard`.
