### Major Changes

- a6d87b1: Agent-scoped API keys: capability sets, per-key rate limits, an audit log and `whoami` (#309, ADR 0051 §7).

  **Breaking — raw per-session access now needs `query:raw`.** `GET /api/v1/sessions/:id/events` and the live per-session follow `GET /api/v1/live/sessions/:id` require **both** `ENABLE_RAW_SESSION_RETENTION` on the collector and the new `query:raw` capability on the key; previously retention alone was enough for any `query` key. Existing keys keep working for every aggregate endpoint and need no migration, but a key that drives session replay or live-follow must be re-minted with `uptimizr new-key <projectId> --capabilities query,query:raw`.

  **Breaking — `@uptimizr/db` metadata contracts.** `ApiKeyCapability` grows from `"ingest" | "query"` to `"ingest" | "query" | "annotate" | "query:raw"`. `ApiKeyRecord` and `ResolvedApiKey` replace the singular `capability` field with `capabilities: ApiKeyCapability[]`, and gain `label` plus a nullable `rateLimit`; `ResolvedApiKey` also carries `keyId`. `createApiKey(client, projectId, capability?)` now takes an options object (`{ capabilities, label, rateLimit }`) on all four engines. Each store package gains `recordAudit` / `listAudit` / `pruneAudit`.

  - Migrations on DuckDB, Postgres, SQL Server and ClickHouse add `capabilities`, `label`, `rate_limit_max`, `rate_limit_window_ms` and an `agent_audit` table. They are forward-only, additive and idempotent (ADR 0007); the legacy `capability` column is untouched and still feeds the read path as a fallback, so keys issued before this release resolve unchanged.
  - Per-key rate limits (`uptimizr new-key --rate-limit-max N --rate-limit-window-ms M`) bucket on the key id instead of the client IP; keys without one keep the global `COLLECTOR_RATE_LIMIT_*` defaults. Keyless ingest is unaffected.
  - `GET /api/v1/whoami` reports the calling key's project, key id, capabilities, label and effective rate limit. `GET /api/v1/audit` (`since`/`until`/`limit`, `query` capability) serves the agent audit trail: key id, route pattern, bounded and redacted params, row count, duration and status, written asynchronously and expiring after `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30).
  - New CLI: `uptimizr new-key <projectId> [--capabilities …] [--label …] [--rate-limit-max N --rate-limit-window-ms M]`. `init` and `new-project` keep minting read-only `query` keys; `uptimizr-db-new-project` gains a `--capabilities` flag.
  - `@uptimizr/react`'s `CollectorApi` takes an optional third `client` argument (default `"dashboard"`) and sends it as `x-uptimizr-client`, which is how the collector tells a dashboard's panel refreshes apart from agent traffic in the audit log. Existing two-argument construction is unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 2f1a753: Add **scene regions** — named, labelled world-space boxes that give a scene a shared vocabulary
  for _where_ things happen ("the entrance", "the checkout counter").

  - `@uptimizr/schema`: `sceneRegionSchema` / `sceneRegionsSchema` (config, deliberately outside the
    event union) plus the `maxSceneRegionLabelLength` / `maxSceneRegionDescriptionLength` /
    `maxSceneRegions` bounds.
  - `@uptimizr/db` and the optional Postgres / SQL Server / ClickHouse stores: a `scene_regions`
    metadata table (forward-only, idempotent migration) keyed `(project_id, scene_id, region_id)`,
    with `putSceneRegions` (replaces a scene's whole set atomically), `getSceneRegions` and
    `listSceneRegions`.
  - `@uptimizr/collector-server`: `PUT` / `GET /api/v1/scenes/:sceneId/regions`, the project-wide
    `GET /api/v1/scene-regions` listing, `uptimizr regions set|get` CLI commands, and `region=<id>`
    as an alternative to the six-number box on every spatial endpoint that already takes a region
    (resolved server-side to the stored bounds; an unregistered id is a `400`). The region reads
    take a `query`-capable key; the **write** takes an `annotate`-capable one (a `query`-only key
    is refused with `403`). `uptimizr regions set` opens the store directly and needs no key.
  - `@uptimizr/sdk-core`: `registerRegions(sceneId, regions, { endpoint, apiKey })`, the authoring
    counterpart to a connector's `scanSceneProxy`.

- ee1b7c7: Coerce numeric columns at every store's edge, so the collector always emits numbers (ADR 0051 §2).

  `@uptimizr/db` gains `coerceRows(metric, rows)`, driven by the metric registry's `row` schema, plus
  `numericColumns` / `numericColumnsOfMetric`; `@uptimizr/metrics` gains the `METRIC_BY_BUILDER`
  reverse lookup behind `metricForBuilder` (pure registry data, so it lives with the registry). Every
  `build*` aggregation now tags its `QuerySpec` with the registry metric id (`QuerySpec.metric`), and
  `runDuckdbQuery`, `runClickhouseQuery`, `runPostgresQuery` and `runMssqlQuery` each apply the
  coercion at the single point rows leave their driver — so a 64-bit integer or decimal that
  ClickHouse renders as `"42"` over HTTP, or an `int8` that `pg` hands back as a string, reaches every
  consumer as a number. `null` is preserved: an aggregate over an empty set means "no samples", never
  `0`. A value that is neither a number, `null`, nor a finite numeric string throws under a test
  runner and is left untouched with a one-per-column warning in production.

  Because the coercion now happens at the edge, the registry's numeric columns are strict `z.number()`
  rather than `z.coerce.number()`, and the collector's query routes carry those schemas as Fastify 200
  response schemas. Tightening the schemas exposed that nine perf/resource metrics can legitimately
  return `null` — SQL aggregates are NULL over an empty set, and a single-row summary is still
  returned when the range matched nothing — so `perf_summary`, `perf_distribution`,
  `frame_time_percentiles`, `jank_rate`, `perf_churn`, `render_scale_truth`, `resource_summary`,
  `resource_percentiles` and `dead_clicks` now declare those columns nullable. Previously
  `z.coerce.number()` silently reported them as `0`; consumers that treated `0` as "measured zero"
  should now read `null` as "no data". Cross-engine parity asserts `typeof === "number"` for every
  registry-numeric column on DuckDB, ClickHouse, Postgres and SQL Server.

### Major Changes

- 9dd78e8: Uptimizr 1.0.0 — first stable release. Every package moves to 1.0.0 together; from here on the public API, the versioned event schema, and the collector's HTTP API follow semantic versioning (a breaking change is a major). Highlights since the public beta: six stable live-JS connectors (Babylon.js, Babylon Lite, three.js, react-three-fiber, PlayCanvas, A-Frame/WebXR) with per-engine capture parity and end-to-end coverage; WebXR in-scene hit resolution; three optional multi-writer stores (ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) behind the same `CollectorStore` contract with cross-engine parity tests; the in-browser analytics assistant with a local (WebLLM) or hosted model, tool-calling over the read-only analytics catalog, and streamed replies; and the MCP server for desktop AI clients. No wire-format or API changes are bundled with this bump — it marks the point where they become breaking.

### Patch Changes

- d71b284: Roll up the open Dependabot updates into a single dependency bump. Refresh
  engine peers and tooling (Babylon.js 9.14, Babylon Lite 1.6, three.js 0.185,
  PlayCanvas 2.20, @clickhouse/client 1.22, fastify-type-provider-zod 7,
  fastify 5.9, astro 7, @types/node 26, plus the minor/patch group and CI
  actions). No public API changes. Babylon Lite 1.6 reads WebGPU bitmask
  globals at import time, so the lite connector's vitest run now stubs those
  globals via a setup file.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 32248e0: feat: reconstruct near-plane origin for flat-pointer click rays (ADR 0043)

  Flat pointers (mouse/touch/stylus) have no native pointing ray, so the click-ray heatmap
  (`/api/v1/heatmaps/click-rays`) collapsed every flat click to the nearest `camera_sample`
  position. Capture the camera's projection intrinsics and unproject each click's `screen` onto the
  camera near plane so flat-pointer rays fan out the way the clicks were actually made.

  - **`@uptimizr/schema`** — `camera_sample` gains optional `aspect` and `near` (alongside the
    existing `fov`).
  - **`@uptimizr/babylon`** — captures `engine.getAspectRatio(camera)` and `camera.minZ`, emitted
    only when finite and positive.
  - **`@uptimizr/db` / `@uptimizr/db-clickhouse`** — `fov`/`aspect`/`near` promoted to dedicated
    columns (forward-only migrations); `buildClickGazeRay` unprojects flat clicks onto the near
    plane using a canonical world-up / no-roll basis.

  Pose sources (XR/hand/gaze) keep their native ray origin (ADR 0011); missing intrinsics (legacy
  data) or a degenerate look-straight-up/down view fall back to the camera position, so existing
  behaviour and parity goldens are unchanged. Additive and non-breaking.

Events and metadata live in one ClickHouse database (no separate service), the schema is created on first boot, and the full analytics surface returns results identical to DuckDB (verified by a cross-engine parity suite). Adds the new `@uptimizr/db-clickhouse` package and the pure `clickhouseDialect` in `@uptimizr/db`. Implements ADR 0020.
