# @uptimizr/db-clickhouse

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- d71b284: Roll up the open Dependabot updates into a single dependency bump. Refresh
  engine peers and tooling (Babylon.js 9.14, Babylon Lite 1.6, three.js 0.185,
  PlayCanvas 2.20, @clickhouse/client 1.22, fastify-type-provider-zod 7,
  fastify 5.9, astro 7, @types/node 26, plus the minor/patch group and CI
  actions). No public API changes. Babylon Lite 1.6 reads WebGPU bitmask
  globals at import time, so the lite connector's vitest run now stubs those
  globals via a setup file.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 32248e0: feat: reconstruct near-plane origin for flat-pointer click rays (ADR 0043)

  Flat pointers (mouse/touch/stylus) have no native pointing ray, so the click-ray heatmap
  (`/api/v1/heatmaps/click-rays`) collapsed every flat click to the nearest `camera_sample`
  position. Capture the camera's projection intrinsics and unproject each click's `screen` onto the
  camera near plane so flat-pointer rays fan out the way the clicks were actually made.

  - **`@uptimizr/schema`** — `camera_sample` gains optional `aspect` and `near` (alongside the
    existing `fov`).
  - **`@uptimizr/babylon`** — captures `engine.getAspectRatio(camera)` and `camera.minZ`, emitted
    only when finite and positive.
  - **`@uptimizr/db` / `@uptimizr/db-clickhouse`** — `fov`/`aspect`/`near` promoted to dedicated
    columns (forward-only migrations); `buildClickGazeRay` unprojects flat clicks onto the near
    plane using a canonical world-up / no-roll basis.

  Pose sources (XR/hand/gaze) keep their native ray origin (ADR 0011); missing intrinsics (legacy
  data) or a degenerate look-straight-up/down view fall back to the camera position, so existing
  behaviour and parity goldens are unchanged. Additive and non-breaking.

### Patch Changes

- df5b66b: chore: point each package's npm `homepage` at its specific docs page (instead of the GitHub tree URL) and add an `author` field across the public manifests.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e78029b: feat: add a single-tenant ClickHouse store (`COLLECTOR_STORE=clickhouse`) for the scale tier. Events and metadata live in one ClickHouse database (no separate service), the schema is created on first boot, and the full analytics surface returns results identical to DuckDB (verified by a cross-engine parity suite). Adds the new `@uptimizr/db-clickhouse` package and the pure `clickhouseDialect` in `@uptimizr/db`. Implements ADR 0020.
