Add the **web-export engine connector** shared foundation and thin Unity / Godot / Unreal
connector packages (ADR 0045, #111).

New `@uptimizr/web-export` package provides the three reusable pieces every web-export connector is
built from: (1) a **versioned JS bridge contract** (`createEngineBridge`, `EngineBridge`,
`BRIDGE_PROTOCOL_VERSION`) — the tiny, stable API a thin engine-side WASM shim calls to push
world-space pose / picks / perf / scene-proxy across the JS interop boundary; (2) a **JS-only
(zero-engine-code) capture tier** (`startJsOnlyCapture`) — pointer move/click heatmaps, rAF FPS +
long-frame perf, and JS error capture driven purely from the `<canvas>` DOM, working for any web
export with no engine changes; and (3) **native-frame normalization** (`normalizePosition`,
`normalizeDirection`, `normalizeAabb`, `rebaseZUpToYUp`) that converts each engine's world-space
data to the canonical wire frame (left-handed, y-up, unit scale 1 — ADR 0018), including the Unreal
z-up→y-up rebase and centimeter→meter scale. Plus `webExportCollector` and a one-call
`trackWebExport`. No `@uptimizr/schema` change is required — connectors emit only existing events.

New `@uptimizr/unity`, `@uptimizr/godot`, and `@uptimizr/unreal` packages are thin wrappers over
`@uptimizr/web-export` with each engine's native frame baked in (Unity: left-handed, y-up, meters —
canonical; Godot: right-handed, y-up, meters — negate Z; Unreal: left-handed, z-up, centimeters —
rebase + scale, best-effort per ADR 0045). Each exposes `<engine>Collector()` and
`track<Engine>()`, and ships a `bridge/` placeholder documenting the engine-side copy-in shim
contract. Full per-engine WASM shims (Unity `.jslib`, Godot `JavaScriptBridge`, Unreal `EM_JS`)
are left to the per-engine sub-issues.
